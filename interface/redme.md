Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement. 
Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way.
When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism"

Interface are similar to abstract classes.
The difference between interfaces and abstract classes are: 
Interfaces cannot have properties, while abstract classes can.
All interface methods must be public, while abstract class methods is public or protected.
