Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They provide a standard way to organize and structure your code to make it more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

__Types of Design Pattern__

__1. Creational Patterns__

These deal with object creation, focusing on how objects are instantiated and how dependencies are managed.

__Factory Pattern__: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
__Singleton Pattern__: Ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.
__Builder Pattern:__ Constructs complex objects step by step.
__Prototype Pattern:__ Creates new objects by cloning existing objects.
__Abstract Factory Pattern:__ Provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
__2. Structural Patterns__
These deal with object composition and relationships, ensuring classes and objects work together effectively.

Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically.
Facade Pattern: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code.
Proxy Pattern: Controls access to an object, often adding functionality like lazy initialization or security.
Composite Pattern: Treats individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Bridge Pattern: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation.
3. Behavioral Patterns
These deal with communication and interaction between objects.

Observer Pattern: Notifies dependent objects of state changes (e.g., event listeners).
Strategy Pattern: Encapsulates different algorithms within interchangeable classes.
Command Pattern: Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing undo/redo functionality.
Iterator Pattern: Sequentially accesses elements in a collection without exposing its structure.
Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses modify parts of the algorithm.
State Pattern: Allows an object to change its behavior when its state changes.
Mediator Pattern: Simplifies communication between objects by introducing a mediator.
Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Passes requests along a chain of handlers.
Why Use Design Patterns?
Reusability: Patterns provide generic solutions that can be reused across projects.
Scalability: They help in designing systems that grow gracefully with added complexity.
Readability: Code written with design patterns is often more readable and maintainable.
Best Practices: Following patterns encourages consistent coding practices
