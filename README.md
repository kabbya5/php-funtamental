Inheritence:
nheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.
The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class.
In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.
An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

Inheritence has main Two goal:

1: Allow Polymorphism,

2: Remove Duplicate Code,

Whit is method Overriding:
Method overriding is a feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass (or derived class) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (or parent class). When a method in a subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in the superclass, the subclass's method is said to override the method of the superclass.

Key Points of Method Overriding:
Same Method Signature: The method in the subclass must have the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the parent class.
Run-time Polymorphism: Method overriding is used to achieve run-time (dynamic) polymorphism. This means the method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type, not the reference type.
