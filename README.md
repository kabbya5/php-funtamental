Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to operate differently depending on the class of the object it is acting upon. There are two main types of polymorphism:

1. Compile-time polymorphism (or static polymorphism): This type is resolved during compile time and often achieved through method overloading (where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters) or operator overloading.

2. Run-time polymorphism (or dynamic polymorphism): This type is resolved during runtime, often achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass.
